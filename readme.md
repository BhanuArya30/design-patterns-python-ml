### TLDR;
- **Factory Pattern**: Use when dynamically selecting models; avoid if only one model is used.
- **Strategy Pattern**: Use when switching between algorithms or optimizers; avoid if the choice is fixed.
- **Singleton Pattern**: Use for shared resources (e.g., config or random state); avoid if you don’t need global state.
- **Observer Pattern**: Use for notifying multiple components during training; avoid if no such notification system is needed.

### 1. **Factory Pattern**

**When to Use**:
- Use the **Factory Pattern** when you need to dynamically decide which machine learning model or algorithm to instantiate based on conditions (e.g., dataset size, problem type, or hyperparameters).
- Useful when you have multiple model types that share a common interface (e.g., Scikit-learn models).

**When Not to Use**:
- Avoid using the Factory Pattern if there is no variation in the model types or if only one type of model is required for your task. It can overcomplicate the design if all models or algorithms are known at compile time.

### 2. **Strategy Pattern**

**When to Use**:
- Use the **Strategy Pattern** when you need to choose between multiple machine learning optimization strategies (e.g., `SGD`, `Adam`, `RMSprop`).
- This pattern is beneficial when the training process can switch between different algorithms or optimizers without modifying the training code itself.

**When Not to Use**:
- Avoid using this pattern if the choice of the algorithm or optimizer is static or determined upfront. In those cases, simple function calls or direct usage will suffice.

### 3. **Singleton Pattern**

**When to Use**:
- Use the **Singleton Pattern** when you need to ensure there is only one instance of a shared resource (e.g., a configuration object, global logging system, or random state generator).
- It’s ideal when you need to manage state globally across multiple classes in a machine learning project.

**When Not to Use**:
- Avoid using Singleton if your application doesn’t need a single, shared resource or when testing is a priority since singletons can make unit testing more complex due to the global state.

### 4. **Observer Pattern**

**When to Use**:
- Use the **Observer Pattern** when you need to notify multiple components (e.g., loggers, monitors, visualizers) about changes during model training (e.g., after each epoch).
- It's useful in scenarios where training progress needs to be communicated to various observers in real-time.

**When Not to Use**:
- Don’t use the Observer Pattern if your system does not need multiple components to be notified of changes or if the training process is simple and doesn't need detailed monitoring.
